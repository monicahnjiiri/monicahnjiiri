## 👋 Hello, World!

My name is Monicah, a Kenyan by birth, a global citizen by passion, and a dreamer by nature. 
I thrive at the intersection of technology and humanity, driven by a mission to make a difference in the world while having fun along the way.

#### Some things that keep me going:
- 📊**Data & visualizations** that actually make sense
- 💻**Python, R, SQL**, and a bit of *"wait, why isn't my code working?"*
- 📚**German?** Already at B2—no more "ich versuche"!
- ☕**Coffee > Tea**. No debate.
- 🌍**Sustainability & environmental impact** — because numbers can help save the planet

🌍 *Wild thought*: They say the Earth is an oblate spheroid… but what if it’s actually a wobbly pancake spinning through space? 🤔 And if gravity ever decides to call it quits, will I just float away with my data and an unfinished machine learning model, desperately trying to run one last line of code? Guess we’ll never know… until we do. 😆🚀
