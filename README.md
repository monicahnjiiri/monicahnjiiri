## 👋 Hello!

Driven by a passion for technology and innovation, I navigate the intersection of data, problem-solving, and impact. Always exploring, learning, and creating solutions that matter.

#### Some things that keep me going:
- 📊**Data & visualizations** that actually make sense
- 💻**Python, R, SQL**, and a bit of *"wait, why isn't my code working?"*
- 📚**German?** Already at B2—no more "ich versuche"!
- ☕**Coffee > Tea**. No debate.
- 🌍**Sustainability & environmental impact** — because numbers can help save the planet
  
### 🛠️ Tech & Tools I Mess Around With
Languages & Databases: Python | SQL
Analytics & BI: Power BI | Excel| Tableau
Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas | Scikit-learn | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn
Version Control & Workflow: Git | GitHub |Kaggle |Streamlit

🌍 *Wild thought*: They say the Earth is an oblate spheroid… but what if it’s actually a wobbly pancake spinning through space? 🤔 And if gravity ever decides to call it quits, will I just float away with my data and an unfinished machine learning model, desperately trying to run one last line of code? Guess we’ll never know… until we do. 😆🚀
